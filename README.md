<h1>GMU CS 321 Project</h1>

<p>Each team of students is to implement a subset of the Hotel Reservation System, which
manages reservations for a small hotel for the month of January (31 days). In order to assist
you with the coding of the framework, each team is provided with a Hotel Reservation System
framework as described in this user guide. </p>

<p>The hotel reservation system framework provides:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Access to system parameters</li>
	<li>Functionality for reading instructions from input files</li>
	<li>Functionality for storing retrieving, updating, and deleting reservations and customers</li>
</ul>
